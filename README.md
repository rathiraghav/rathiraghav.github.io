# Raghav Rathi
I am a Highly organized and detail-oriented student of MediCaps university who has excellent communication skills, enabling me to effectively communicate with a wide range of people. I am seeing a part-time position in the industry in which I can put into practice my knowledge and experience, ultimately benefiting the operations of the organization that I work for. I like to play football and volleyball and I have an interest in learning new things and exploring new dimensions of my life.
